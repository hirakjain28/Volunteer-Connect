This project connects NGOs and volunteers through a web platform that allows both parties to create profiles, find the best matches based on skills and interests, and collaborate on impactful projects.

Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB, it features real-time volunteer selection, email notifications, and a user-friendly interface for seamless engagement.

Our goal is to empower NGOs to find skilled volunteers easily and help volunteers contribute to causes they care about.
